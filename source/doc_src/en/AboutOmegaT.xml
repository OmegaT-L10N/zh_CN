    Aided Translation tool, with the following highlights:</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Translation
        memory:</emphasis><application> OmegaT</application> stores your
        translations in a translation memory file. At the same time, it can
        use memories files from previous translations for reference.
        Translation memories can be very useful in a translation where there
        are numerous repetitions or reasonably similar segments of text.
        OmegaT uses translation memories to store your previous translations
        and then suggest likely translations for the text you are currently
        working on.</para>

        <para>These translation memories can be very useful when a document
        that has already been translated needs to be updated. Unchanged
        sentences are automatically translated, while updated sentences are
        shown with the translation of the most similar, older sentence.
        Modifications to the original document are thus handled with greater
        ease. If you are supplied with previously created translation memories
        , for example by your translation agency or your client, OmegaT is
        able to use these as reference memories.</para>

        <para>OmegaT uses the standard tmx file format to store and access
        translation memories, which guarantees that you can exchange your
        translation material with other CAT applications supporting this file
        format.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Terminology management</emphasis>:
        Terminology management is important for translation consistency.
        OmegaT uses glossaries containing translations of single words or
        small phrases: a simplified bilingual dictionary for a specific
        domain. For your reference, OmegaT displays the translation of any
        word that is both present in the segment and registered in the glossary.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Translation process:</emphasis> Imagine
        having to translate something; from a single file to a folder
        containing subfolders each with a number of files in a variety of
        formats. When you let OmegaT know the files that you need to
        translate, it looks for the files it understands based on file
        filtering rules, recognizes the textual parts within them, splits up
        the text groups according to the segmentation rules, and displays the
        segments one by one so that you can proceed with the translation.
        OmegaT stores your translations and proposes possible translations
        from similar segments in registered in the translation memory files. 
        When you are ready to view the final product, you can export the
        translated files, open them in the appropriate application and view
        the translation in the final format...</para>

        tools work with textual units called segments. In OmegaT, segments can
        be based on paragraphs or on segmentation rules. Paragraph
        segmentation is less frequently used, but can be useful in cases of
        so-called "creative" texts. The rule-based segmentation is usually
        synonymous with sentence-based segmentation. A number of rule sets are
        provided while additional rules can be defined by the user, as
        described in this chapter.</para>

        ". </emphasis> They can also be complex, allowing for instance to
        search for segments with two or more consecutive spaces. In this case
        the regular expression ^s^s+ would be used to find and list the
        offending segments. Regular expressions are also used extensively in
        the segmentation rules.</para>

        extensive use of dictionaries and glossaries. If an Internet
        connection is available, various MT services such as Google Translate
        and Microsoft Translator can be used from within OmegaT. If spell
        checking is activated, spelling mistakes and typos are recognized and
        can be corrected during translation. The open source LanguageTool can
        be used to correct common grammatical and stylistic mistakes.</para>
