  <title><application>OmegaT</application> Files and Folders</title>

  <para><application>OmegaT</application> works with three types of
  files.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Translation project files: These constitute a translation project.
      Losing them may affect the project's integrity and your ability to
      complete a job. Project files are the most important files in
      <application>OmegaT</application>. They are the files you deal with on a
      daily basis while translating.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>User settings files: These are created when OmegaT's behavior is
      modified by user preference settings. Losing them usually results in
      OmegaT reverting to its "factory settings". This can sometimes cause a
      little trouble when you are in the middle of a translation.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Application files: These are included in the package you download.
      Most of them are required in order for OmegaT to function properly. If
      for some reason these files are lost or corrupted, simply download
      and/or reinstall OmegaT to restore them all.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <section id="translation.project.files">
    <title>Translation project files</title>

    <indexterm class="singular">
      <primary>Project files</primary>

      <secondary>Translation project files</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>An <application>OmegaT</application> translation project consists of
    a number of files and folders.</para>

    <para>When you create a translation project, OmegaT automatically creates
    a folder with the specified name, and a list of folders:</para>

    <figure id="OmegaT.project">
      <title>OmegaT project</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject role="html">
		          <imagedata fileref="images/Omegatproject.png"/>
       </imageobject>
      <imageobject role="fo">
          <imagedata fileref="images/Omegatproject.png" width="60%"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
	  </figure>

    <para>Alternate locations for some of the folders can be chosen at project
    creation or during the translation. It is therefore possible to select
    existing folders or create folders in locations that reflect your work
    flow and project management habits. To change the location of folders
    after a project has been created, open <guimenuitem>Project &gt;
    Properties...</guimenuitem> in the menu or with
    <guibutton>Ctrl+E</guibutton> and make the necessary changes.</para>

    <para>In a file manager a translation project looks and acts just like any
    other folder. In the following example the folder <filename>my
    projects</filename> contains three OmegaT projects:</para>

    <para><figure id="OmegaT.projects.and.subfolders">
        <title>OmegaT projects and subfolders</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/OmegaT_projects_and_subfolders.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure></para>

    <para>Double clicking the item with the OmegaT icon is sufficient to open
    the project. A translation project <emphasis
    role="bold">Example_Project</emphasis> created with the default settings
    will be created as a new subfolder with the following structure:</para>

    <section id="file.omegat.project">
      <title>Top folder<indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Project files</primary>

          <secondary>File omegat.project</secondary>
        </indexterm></title>

      <para>Top folder of a project always contains the file<filename>
      OmegaT.Project</filename>, containing project parameters as defined in
      the Project properties window (<guimenuitem>Project &gt;
      Properties</guimenuitem>). While the translation is progressing,
      additional files
      (<emphasis><filename>project_name</filename></emphasis><filename>-omegat.tmx,
      project_name-level1.tmx and project_name-level2.tmx</filename>) are
      created (and updated during the process of translation) in this folder.
      They contain the one and the same translation memory contents in
      different forms, to be used in future projects.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Subfolder dictionary</title>

      <para>Initially empty, this folder will contain dictionaries you have
      added to the project. See <link linkend="chapter.dictionaries">chapter
      Dictionaries</link> for more on this subject.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Subfolder glossary</title>

      <para>This folder is initially empty. It will contain glossaries you
      will be using in the project. See <link
      linkend="chapter.glossaries">chapter Glossaries</link> for more on this
      subject.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="folder.OmegaT">
      <title>Subfolder omegat<indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Project files</primary>

          <secondary>Subfolder omegat</secondary>
        </indexterm></title>

      <para>The <emphasis role="bold">omegat</emphasis> subfolder contains at
      least one and possibly several other files. The most important file here
      is the <filename>project_save.tmx, </filename>that is the working
      translation memory for the project. Backups of this file (with extension
      bak) are added progressively to this subfolder, first at the beginning
      of the translation session, at its end, and while the translation
      progresses. This way an inadvertent data loss is averted - see
      Preventing Data Loss in chapter <link
      linkend="chapter.misc">Miscellanea.</link></para>

      subfolder as follows</para>

      <para>The source subfolder contains files to be translated. You can add

      may take any form you like. If the files to be translated are parts of a
      tree structure (as in a website), you need only specify the top-level
      subfolder and OmegaT will maintain the entire contents, while keeping
      the tree structure intact.</para>

    <para>OmegaT is supplied as a package that can be downloaded from
    SourceForge. Here a platform-independent package in a standard Java form
    is considered. Alternatives include a Linux .tar package, a Windows
    installer – with or without a Java Runtime Environment –, a Mac OS X
    installer, and a source code package for developers.</para>

    <para>The platform-independent package can be used on any platform with a
    working Java 1.6 runtime environment, including the platforms for which a
    specific package also exists. It is provided as a compressed file (zip or
    tar archive) that you must extract to the folder of your choice for
    installation. The file can usually be extracted by double-clicking on the
    downloaded package. Once the archive has been extracted, a folder
    containing the following contents is created:</para>
