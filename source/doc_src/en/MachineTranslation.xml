    <para>As opposed to user-generated translation memories (as in the case of
    <application>OmegaT</application>) Machine translation (MT) tools use
    rule-based linguistic tools to create a translation of the source segment
    without the need for a translation memory. Statistical learning
    techniques, based on source and target texts, are used to build a
    translation model. Machine translation services have been achieving good
    and steadfastly improving results in research evaluations.</para>

    <para>To activate any of the Machine Translation services, go to
    <guimenuitem>Options &gt; Machine Translate ...</guimenuitem> and activate
    the service desired. Note that they are all web-based: you will have to be
    on-line if you want to use them.</para>

    <para>Google Translate is a payable service offered by Google, for
    translating sentences, web sites and complete texts between an
    ever-growing number of languages. At the time of writing the list includes
    more than 50 languages, from Albanian to Yiddish, including of course all
    the major languages. The current version of the service is based on usage,
    with the price of 20 USD per million characters at the time of writing.

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Important: </emphasis>Google Translate API v2
    requires billing information for all accounts before you can start using
    the service (see <ulink
    url="https://developers.google.com/translate/v2/pricing?hl=en-US">Pricing
    and Terms of Service</ulink> for more). To identify yourself as a valid
    user for the Google services, you use your private unique key sent to you
    by Google, when you have registered for the service. See chapter <link
    linkend="chapter.installing.and.running">Installing and Running</link>,
    section Launch command arguments, for details on how to add this key to
    the OmegaT environment.</para>

    <para>The quality of the Google Translate translation depends on one side
    on the reservoir of target-language texts and the availability of their
    bilingual versions, on the other hand on the quality of the models built.
    It is pretty much certain that while the quality may be insufficient in
    some cases, it will definitely get better with time and not worse.</para>

    <title><application>OmegaT</application> users and Google
    Translate</title>

    <para>The <application>OmegaT</application> user is not forced to use
    Google Translate. If used, neither the user's decision to accept the
    translation nor the final translation are made available to Google. The
    following window shows an example of a) the English source b) Spanish and
    c) Slovenian Google Translate translation.</para>

    <para>The Spanish translation is better than the Slovenian. Note
    <emphasis>interesar</emphasis> and<emphasis> navegar</emphasis> in
    Spanish, are correctly translated as the verbs interest and sail
    respectively. In the Slovenian version both words have been translated as
    nouns. It is actually quite probable that the Spanish translation is based
    at least partially on the actual translation of the book.</para>

    <para>Once you have activated the service, a suggestion for the
    translation will appear in the Machine Translate pane every time a new
    source segment is opened. If you find the suggestion acceptable, press
    <keycombo>
        <keycap><indexterm class="singular">

        <keycap>M</keycap>
      </keycombo> to replace the target part of the opened segment with the
    suggestion. In the above segment, for instance, <keycombo>
        <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>

        <keycap>M</keycap>
      </keycombo> would replace the Spanish version with the Slovenian
    suggestion.</para>

    <para>If you do not wish <application>OmegaT</application> to send your
    source segments to Google to get translated, untick the Google Translate
    menu entry in Options.</para>

    <para>Note that nothing but your source segment is sent to the MT service.
    The online version of Google Translate allows the user to correct the
    suggestion and send the corrected segment in. This feature, however, is
    not implemented in OmegaT.</para>

    <para><ulink url="http://www.apertium.org/">Apertium</ulink> is a
    free/open-source machine translation platform, initially aimed at
    related-language pairs, like CA, ES, GA, PT, OC and FR but recently
    expanded to deal with more divergent language pairs (such as

    <para>Apertium uses a shallow-transfer machine translation engine which
    processes the input text in stages, as in an assembly line: de-formatting,
    morphological analysis, part-of-speech disambiguation, shallow structural
    transfer, lexical transfer, morphological generation, and
    re-formatting.</para>

    <para>It is possible to use Apertium to build machine translation systems
    for a variety of language pairs; to that end, Apertium uses simple
    XML-based standard formats to encode the linguistic data needed (either by
    hand or by converting existing data), which are compiled using the
    provided tools into the high-speed formats used by the engine.</para>
