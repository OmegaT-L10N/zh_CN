    <para>It is possible to modify the project properties during a translation
    session. Note that changes to the project setup may have some
    consequences, especially, when the project has already been started. Until
    you have some experience with OmegaT, it is safest to consider all
    settings final once the translation has started â€“ unless of course you
    realize a major mistake has been made. See the section Preventing data
    loss for ways and means of protecting your work.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">An area for setting project source and
        target languages</emphasis></para>

        <para>You can either enter the source and target languages by hand or
        use the drop down menus. Bear in mind that changing the languages may
        render the currently used translation memories useless since their
        language pair may not longer match the new languages.</para>

        segmentation</guilabel> </emphasis>check box</para>

          <primary>Project</primary>

          <secondary>Enable Sentence-level segmentation</secondary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>The segmentation settings only address the way the source files
        are handled by <application>OmegaT</application>. The predominant way
        of segmenting the sources is the sentence-level segmenting, so this
        check box should in a normal case be left checked.</para>

        <para>In some seldom cases the alternative, i.e. segmenting by
        paragraphs, may be preferred. Changing this flag does not modify the
        segmentation of already existing translation memories. If you decide
        mid-translation to switch from sentence to paragraph translation, the
        internal translation memory of the project will not be changed (OmegaT
        may upgrade old translation memories that did not use sentence
        segmentation, but not vice versa).</para>

        <para>Changing segmentation settings may cause some already translated
        segments to be split or merged. This will effectively return them to
        the "untranslated" status, as they will no longer match segments
        recorded in the project memory, even though their original translation
        is still there.</para>

            <secondary>global vs project rules</secondary>
          </indexterm></para>

        <para>The segmentation rules are generally valid across all the
        projects. The user, however, may need to generate a set of rules,
        specific to the project in question. Use this button to open a
        dialog,activate the check box <guimenuitem>Project specific
        segmentation rules</guimenuitem>, then proceed to adjust the
        segmentation rules as desired. The new set of rules will be stored
        together with the project and will not interfere with the general set
        of segmentation rules. To delete project specific segmentation rules,
        uncheck the check box. See chapter <link
        linkend="chapter.segmentation">Source Segmentation</link> for more
        information on segmentation rules. <emphasis/></para>

        <para><emphasis>Hint:</emphasis> the set of segmentation rules for a
        given project is stored as
        <filename>project/omegat/segmentation.conf.</filename></para>

            <primary>File filters</primary>

            <secondary>global vs project file filters</secondary>
          </indexterm></para>

        <para>In a similar fashion as above the user can create
        project-specific File filters, which will be stored together with the
        project and will be valid for the current project only. To create a
        project-specific set of file filters, click on the <guibutton>File
        filter ... </guibutton>button, then activate <guimenuitem>Enable
        project specific filters</guimenuitem> check box in the window, that
        opens. A copy of the changed filters configuration will be stored with
        the project. To delete project specific file filters, uncheck the
        check box. Note that in the menu <guimenuitem>Options-&gt;File
        Filters</guimenuitem>, the global user filters are changed, not the
        project filters. See chapter<link linkend="chapter.file.filters"> File
        filters </link>for more on the subject. <emphasis/></para>

        <para><emphasis>Hint:</emphasis> the set of file filters for a given
        project is stored as

          </indexterm></emphasis></para>

        <para>In case there are non-unique segments in source documents, the
        Auto-propagation check box offers the user the following two
        possibilities as regards automatic translation: if checked, the first
        translated segment will be assumed as the default translation and its
        target text will be automatically used for later hits during the
        translation process. Mistranslated segments can of course be corrected
        later manually using <guimenuitem>Create Alternative
        Translation</guimenuitem>. If the Auto-propagation check box is not
        checked, the segments with alternative translations are left
        untranslated until the user has decided which translation is to be
        used.</para>

            <secondary>Remove tags option</secondary>
          </indexterm></para>

        <para>When enabled, all the formatting tags are removed from source
        segments. This is especially useful when dealing with texts where
        inline formatting is not really useful (e.g., OCRed PDF, bad converted
        .odt or .docx, etc.) In a normal case it should always be possible to
        open the target documents, as only inline tags are removed.
        Non-visible formatting (i.e., which doesn't appear as tags in the
        OmegaT editor) is retained in target documents.</para>

        <para>Here you can select different subfolders, for instance the
        subfolder with source files, subfolder for target files etc. If you
        enter names of folders that do not exist yet,
        <application>OmegaT</application> creates them for you. In case you
        decide to modify project folders, keep in mind that this will not move
        existing files from old folders to the new location.</para>
