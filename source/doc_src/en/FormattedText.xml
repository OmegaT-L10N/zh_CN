  <para>Formatting information present in the source file usually needs to be
  reproduced in the target file. The in-line formatting information made
  possible by the supported formats (in particular DocBook, HTML, XHTML, Open
  Document Format(ODF) and Office Open XML (MS Office 2007 and later) at
  the time of writing) is presented as tags in OmegaT. Normally tags are
  ignored when considering the similarity between different texts for matching
  purposes. Tags reproduced in the translated segment will be present in the
  translated document.</para>

      </indexterm><emphasis role="bold">Tag naming:</emphasis></para>

    <para>The tags consist of one to three characters and a number. Unique
    numbering allows tags, corresponding to each other to be grouped together
    and differentiates between tags, that have the same shortcut character,
    but are in fact different. The shortcut characters used try to reflect the
    underlying meaning of the tag (e.g. b for bold, i for italics,
    etc.)</para>

        <secondary>Numbering</secondary>
      </indexterm><emphasis role="bold">Tag numbering:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Tags are numbered incrementally by tag group. "Tag groups" in this
    context are a single tag (such as &lt;i0&gt; and &lt;/i0&gt;). Within a
    segment, the first group (pair or single) receives the number 0, the
    second the number 1 etc. The first example below has 3 tag groups (a pair,
    a single, and then another pair), the second example has one group only (a
    pair).</para>

        <primary>Tags</primary>

        <secondary>Pairs and singles</secondary>
      </indexterm><emphasis role="bold">Pairs and singles:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Tags are always either singles or paired. Single tags indicate
    formatting information that does not affect the surrounding text (an extra
    space or line break for example).</para>

    <para><literal>&lt;b0&gt;&lt;Ctr+N&gt;&lt;/b0&gt;,
    &lt;br1&gt;&lt;b2&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;&lt;/b2&gt;&lt;segment 2132&gt;
    </literal></para>

    <para>&lt;br1&gt; is a single tag and does not affect any surrounding
    text. Paired tags usually indicate style information that applies to the
    text between the opening tag and the closing tag of a pair. &lt;b0&gt; and
    &lt;/b0&gt; below are paired and affect the text log.txt. Note that the
    opening tag must always come before the corresponding closing tag:</para>

    <para>&lt;<literal>Log file (&lt;b0&gt;log.txt&lt;/b0&gt;) for tracking
    operations and errors.&lt;segment 3167&gt;</literal></para>

    <para><application>OmegaT</application> creates its tags before the
    process of sentence segmenting. Depending upon the segmenting rules, the
    pair of tags may get separated into two consecutive segments and the tag
    validation will err on the side of caution and mark the two
    segments.</para>

    <para>Care must be exercised with tags. If they are accidentally changed,
    the formatting of the final file may be corrupted. The basic rule is that
    the sequence of tags must be preserved in the same order. However, it is
    possible, if certain rules are strictly followed, to deviate from this
    basic rule.</para>

        <secondary>Duplication</secondary>
      </indexterm>Tag duplication: </emphasis></para>

    <para>To duplicate tag groups, just copy them in the position of your
    choice. Keep in mind that in a pair group, the opening tag must come
    before the closing tag. The formatting represented by the group you have
    duplicated will be applied to both sections.</para>

    <para>Example:</para>

    <para><literal>&lt;b0&gt;This formatting&lt;/b0&gt; is going to be
    duplicated here.&lt;segment 0001&gt; </literal></para>

    <para>After duplication:</para>

    <para><literal>&lt;b0&gt;This formatting&lt;/b0&gt; has been
    &lt;b0&gt;duplicated here&lt;/b0&gt;.&lt;segment 0001&gt;

        <secondary>Group deletion</secondary>
      </indexterm>Tag group deletion:</emphasis></para>

    <para>To delete tag groups, just remove them from the segment. Keep in
    mind that a pair group must have both its opening and its closing tag
    deleted to ensure that all traces of the formatting are properly erased,
    otherwise the translated file may become corrupted. By deleting a tag
    group you will remove the related formatting from the translated
    file.</para>

    <para>Example:</para>

    <para><literal>&lt;b0&gt;This formatting&lt;/b0&gt; is going to be
    deleted.&lt;segment 0001&gt; </literal></para>

      </indexterm></title>

    <para>Modifying tag group order may result in the nesting of a tag group
    within another tag group. This is acceptable, provided the enclosing group
    totally encloses the enclosed group. In other words, when moving paired
    tags, ensure that both the opening and the closing tag are both either
    inside or outside other tag pairs, or the translated file may be corrupted
    and fail to open.</para>

    <para>Example:</para>

    <para><literal>&lt;b0&gt;Formatting&lt;/b0&gt; &lt;b1&gt;one&lt;/b1&gt; is
    going to be nested inside formatting zero.&lt;segment 0001&gt;

    <para>After nesting:</para>

    <para><literal>&lt;b0&gt;Formatting &lt;b1&gt;one&lt;/b1&gt;&lt;/b0&gt;

    <para>Overlapping is the result of bad manipulations of tag pairs and is
    guaranteed to result in formatting corruption and sometimes in the
    translated file not opening at all.</para>

    <para>Example:</para>

    <para><literal>&lt;b0&gt;Formatting&lt;/b0&gt; &lt;b1&gt;one&lt;/b1&gt; is
    going to be messed up.&lt;segment 0001&gt; </literal></para>

        remove pattern is ignored. A fixed penalty of 5 is added if the
        removed part does not match some other segment, so the match does not
        show up as 100%</para>

    <para>The validate tags function detects changes to tag sequences (whether

    the file containing suspected broken or bad tags in the translation.
    Repairing the tags and recreating the target documents is easy with the
    validate tags function. The window that opens when
    <guimenuitem>Ctrl+T</guimenuitem> is pressed features a 3-column table

    <para>The tags are highlighted in bold blue for easy comparison between

    <guimenuitem>Ctrl+T</guimenuitem> to return to the tag validation window
    to correct other errors. Tag errors are tag sequences in the translation
    in which the same tag order and number as in the original segment is not
    reproduced. Some tag manipulations are necessary and are benign, others
    will cause problems when the translated document is created.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Simplify the original text</emphasis></para>

    <para>Tags generally represent formatting in some form of the original
    text. Simplifying the original formatting greatly contributes to reducing
    the number of tags. Where circumstances permit, unifying used fonts, font
    sizes, colors, etc. should be considered, as it could simplify the
    translation and reduce the potential for tag errors. Read the tag
    operations section to see what can be done with tags. Remember that if you
    find tags a problem in OmegaT and formatting is not extremely relevant for
    the current translation, removing tags may be the easiest way out of
    problems.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Pay extra attention to tag
    pairs</emphasis></para>

    <para>If you need to see tags in OmegaT but do not need to retain most of
    the formatting in the translated document you are free not to include tags
    in the translation. In this case pay extra attention to tag pairs since
    deleting one side of the pair but forgetting to delete the other is
    guaranteed to corrupt your document's formatting. Since tags are included
    in the text itself, it is possible to use segmentation rules to create
    segments with fewer tags. This is an advanced feature and some experience
    is required in order for it to be applied properly.</para>

    <para>OmegaT is not yet able to detect mistakes in formatting fully
    automatically, so it will not prompt you if you make an error or change
    formatting to fit your target language better. Sometimes, however, your
    translated file may look strange, and – in the worst case – may even
    refuse to open.</para>
