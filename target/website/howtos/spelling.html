<p>OmegaT has an inline spelling checker. This feature makes use of the spelling dictionaries used in LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org. Dictionaries are available for a large number of languages.</p>

<h3>在OmegaT中安装新的拼写检查工具</h3>

<p>New spelling dictionaries can be installed from within OmegaT in the Options &gt; Spell Checking dialog. In this dialog, select or create a dictionary file folder on your hard drive. This is the folder in which the spelling dictionary files will be placed. (Do not confuse this folder with the "dictionary" folder in OmegaT projects.) Then select the URL (website address) of an online repository from which to download the dictionary or dictionaries, and paste this URL into the "URL of online dictionaries" field. A list of repository URLs is provided below.  </p>

<h3>手动安装新拼写词典</h3>

<p>在选项&gt;拼写检查对话框中，先在你的硬盘中选择或创建一个字典文件夹。</p>

<p>获取想要使用的字典的.dic和.aff文件，把这些文件放入此文件夹。</p>

<p>Besides being available from the repositories above, spelling dictionaries are available as part of LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org installations. LibreOffice and more recent versions of OpenOffice.org now use the "extensions" format for these dictionaries, in which the files are supplied in a a zip archive with the extension .oxt. To use spelling dictionaries in this format, rename the file extension from .oxt to .zip and using a zip archive application (such as WinZip) to extract the .dic and .aff files.</p>

<p>The names of the files must correspond to the language code of your target language as defined in the project properties dialog (Project &gt; Properties). For example, if you have selected ES-MX (Mexican Spanish) as the target language, the dictionary files must be named es_MX.dic and es_MX.aff. If you only have a Bolivian Spanish dictionary available, with the file names es_BO.dic and es_BO.aff, you can rename these files es_MX.dic and es_MX.aff, and the spelling dictionary will work. (It will, of course, check for Bolivian rather than Mexican Spanish!)</p>

<h3>解决问题备忘录</h3>

<p>检查拼写检查对话框中，该项功能已开启。</p>

<p>If the automatic installation process does not work: check that your Internet connection is working; if so, try a different repository URL. Check that you have write permissions for the spelling dictionary folder you have selected.</p>

<p>检查当前拼写字典文件夹中的.dic和.aff文件的语言类型，以及文件名是否与目标语言代码一致。</p>
