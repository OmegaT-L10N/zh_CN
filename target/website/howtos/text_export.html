<p>Since version 2.0.1, OmegaT has had a text export function. This HOWTO describes the function and possible uses for it. In addition, the package <a href="{{ '/files/omegatk/te-scripts.zip' | prepend: site.baseurl_root }}">te-scripts.zip</a> contains some very simple tcl/tk scripts which are intended to illustrate use of the function.</p>

<h3>目的</h3>

<p>The text export function exports data from within the current OmegaT project to plain-text files. At present, the data exported are:</p>

<p>- The content of the segment source text, when the segment is opened<br/>
- The content of the segment target text, when the segment is opened<br/>
- Highlighted text in the target text, when the relevant shortcut is pressed</p>

<p>Programmers and scripters can use the files containing this text in order to add further functions to OmegaT. They need no knowledge of Java; most if not all programming languages could be used instead, and useful functions achieved even with only relatively limited programming skill.</p>

<h3>使用文本导出功能</h3>

<p>若要使用文本导出功能，务必先启用OmegaT内的该项功能：</p>

<p>选项菜单&gt;编辑行为</p>

<p>然后，点击“将片段导出到文本文件”选框。</p>

<p>导出的文件会保存到OmegaT用户文件中的/script子文件夹中（OmegaT用户文件夹在你的操作系统中的存储位置，参见使用手册（在OmegaT软件中使用F1键）&gt;文件和目录&gt;用户文件）：</p>

<p>source.txt	- contains the source text of the segment<br/>
target.txt	- contains the target text of the segment<br/>
selection.txt	- contains the text highlighted by the user, when Ctrl-Shift-C is pressed or Edit &gt; Export Selection is selected</p>

<p>The content of the files is overwritten either when a new segment is opened (source.txt and target.txt) or when a new selection is exported (selection.txt). The files are unformatted plain-text files.</p>

<h3>使用样本脚本</h3>

<p>Tcl/tk must be installed, if it is not already. Tcl/tk can be obtained from a number of sources; tcl.activestate.com is one popular source. Mac OSX users should install tcl/tk from their system media and Linux users should find it in their distribution's repository, if it is not already installed by default. (Note to Ubuntu users: the font implementation of the default tcl/tk installation in Ubuntu at the present time (version 9.10) is appalling, but can be rectified.)</p>

<p>In order to make the workings of the script code clearer, each script essentially performs only one function. If multiple functions were to be used at the same time in practice, it would be more efficient to combine them in a single script file.</p>

<p>所提供的样例脚本 <a href="{{ '/files/omegatk/te-scripts.zip' | prepend: site.baseurl_root }}">这里</a>都会运行一个窗口，但那些可以在背景中实现功能的脚本都十分好理解。 </p>

<p>运行脚本：</p>

<p>复制脚本文件到OmegaT的“script”文件夹，即包含source.txt等文件的文件夹。（脚本文件原则上可以放在任意处，但随后编辑时必须要加上脚本文件的路径。）</p>

<p>Depending upon how your system is configured, it may be possible to launch the scripts simply by clicking on them with the mouse. Alternatively:</p>

<p>打开命令行窗口（DOS prompt, terminal, console）</p>

<p>将文件夹目录转向脚本文件夹，例如，（Windows XP系统）：</p>

<p>cd C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\Application Data\OmegaT\script</p>

<p>用“wish”加脚本文件名运行脚本，例如：</p>

<p>wish te-basic-source.tcl</p>

<h3>单个脚本描述</h3>

<p><strong>te-basic-source</strong></p>

<p>This script displays the source text in a separate window. As such, it does nothing not already done by the OmegaT Editor pane; its purpose is to illustrate how the text can be extracted from a script file and made available for further scripts. The content of the script window is editable and can be copied and pasted back into the OmegaT Editor pane.</p>

<p><strong>te-basic-target</strong></p>

<p>该脚本是针对te-basic-target，而不是针对目标文本的。</p>

<p><strong>te-warning</strong></p>

<p>Besides displaying the source text, this script provides an entry box into which the user can type a string (e.g. a word). When an OmegaT segment containing this string is opened, the script outputs a warning. The warning takes the form of the text in the script window being highlighted in yellow. In addition, if supported by the hardware and operating system (this is not always the case), a beep will sound.</p>

<p>An example use of this function is as follows. The translator has a text containing the phrase "abc", and has completed a first draft of it, translating "abc" as "abc". She then discovers that "abc" should be translated as "def". Rather than find all the cases of "abc" and correcting them before proceeding (which is possible, but has drawbacks), she could simply decide to correct them in course of the next draft. In this case, a "reminder" in each relevant segment may be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>te-notags</strong></p>

<p>As its name suggests, this script automatically strips the tags out of an OmegaT (target) segment. This is useful when <i>checking</i> tag-heavy segments on the screen, since it is easy to overlook missing or double spaces, for example.</p>

<p><strong>te-tags</strong></p>

<p>This script displays the target segment in a particular font (hard-coded in the script, but can be edited) rather than the default font. The tags are displayed in a different font in order to make them less intrusive. Unlike te-notags, it is possible for the translator to work in this window, then copy and paste the content in full to the OmegaT editor pane.</p>

<p><strong>te-gloss-highlight</strong></p>

<p>This script reads the content of a glossary file and highlights any terms found in it in the current (source) segment. The glossary file must consist of two columns only, have the name GLOSS.utf8, and be present in the /script folder.</p>

<p><strong>te-gloss-subst</strong></p>

<p>与 te-gloss-highlight类似，但会用目标术语替换词汇表中的源术语。</p>

<p><strong>te-gloss-subst-highlight</strong></p>

<p>结合te-gloss-highlight和te-gloss-subst的替换和高亮显示功能。</p>

<h3>在tcl/tk中编程</h3>

<p>Tcl/tk作为一种脚本语言，具有很多优势：</p>

<p>- It is easy to learn<br/>
- It is free<br/>
- It is widely used, so help can be found on the Internet<br/>
- The Tk component makes it easy to produce graphical user interfaces<br/>
- There are many good books and other resources available for it (at least in English)<br/>
- It is string-oriented, making it particularly suitable for applications involving text</p>

<p>对于初学者来说，网上有许多可用的教程，如：</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/kZWsj">www.dci.clrc.ac.uk/Publications/Cookbook/index.html</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/tutorial/tcltutorial.html">www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/tutorial/tcltutorial.html</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/tcl-tk/">www.tutorialspoint.com/tcl-tk/</a></p>

<p>If you are serious about learning tcl/tk, "Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk" by Brent Welch, ISBN: 0-13-038560-3 is strongly recommended. This is likely to be a little too technical for complete newcomers to programming, but after working through one of the online tutorials, they should find it useful.</p>
