  <p>This HowTo provides information on using OmegaT on Linux. It is particularly aimed at users who are new to Linux.</p>
  <h3> Java</h3>
  <p>OmegaT does not run satisfactorily on all versions of Java. If Java is already installed on your system (which is probably the case) and you plan to use this existing, system-wide Java installation in conjunction with OmegaT, first check that it is suitable. To do this, open a terminal (also known as a console or command-line window; common programs for this are konsole (KDE) and gnome-terminal (GNOME)), and type:</p>
  <p>java—版本</p>
  <p>该系统会输出已安装在系统层面的java版本的细节信息。</p>
  <p>Oracle（以前称为Sun）Java版本：在 OmegaT文档中(readme.txt)查找系统的要求以获得Oracle Java版本所要求的准确信息（也就是您的Java版本是否足够新）。</p>
  <p>Third-party Java versions: until relatively recently, OmegaT ran only on Oracle/Sun's own Java. OmegaT will now run on the OpenJDK Java implementation supplied with some Linux distributions, but some functions (such as the full set of command-line options) may not be available; a different font set may be supplied; and some glitches have been reported, such as with window display and the segmentation function.</p>
  <p>如果您不确定您的Java版本是否适合，您可以：</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simply install an OmegaT version without Java and see whether it works. If it does not, you still have the option to install a local version of Java or a different version of Java at system level.</li>
    <li>在系统层面安装第二个非默认版本的Java，并明确使用此版本启动OmegaT。</li>
    <li>安装包含Java的OmegaT版本。</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you establish that the version of Java installed at system level is not compatible with OmegaT and you wish to replace this Java version with the Oracle Java version, check first whether an Oracle package is available for your Linux distribution (SUSE, Ubuntu, etc.). If so, this makes installation much easier.</p>
  <p>If you obtain the Oracle version of Java directly from Oracle, installation is likely to be straightforward, but you will have to configure it manually in order to make it the default version at system level. This is not recommended, particularly if you are unfamiliar with Linux.</p>
  <p>第三个选择，即在本地级别安装包含Java的OmegaT版本。这始终是“安全”的选项，并且我们建议使用。</p>
  <h3>选择和下载OmegaT</h3>
  <p>以下版本的OmegaT适用于Linux：</p>
  <p>"Standard", "Latest", "/trunk"  and "Webstart". The "Latest" version is recommended. (Refer to the "Downloads" page on the OmegaT website for details of the differences.)</p>
  <p>Without/with JRE included, i.e. the cross-platform without JRE, e.g. "OmegaT_2.1.7_02_Beta_Without_JRE.zip" and the Linux-specific version with JRE, e.g. "OmegaT_2.1.7_02_Beta_Linux.tar.bz2". Select a version without or with JRE depending upon your Java situation (see above).</p>
  <p>As an open-source application, OmegaT has been included by many Linux distributions in their repositories, so you may be able to install it by this route. Note however that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most Linux distributions use the OpenJDK version of Java by default. At the time of writing, OmegaT will run much better with the Oracle version of Java (see above).</li>
    <li>The OmegaT version usually supplied is the "Standard" version. More functions will usually be found in the "Latest" version.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that it is easy to install multiple versions of OmegaT on Linux without conflicts. They will however always access the same user configuration files (unless launched from a different user account).</p>
  <h3>安装 OmegaT</h3>
  <p>The Linux version of OmegaT is now supplied with its own installation script, linux-install.sh. This script:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>将 OmegaT 程序文件放入 /opt/omegat/OmegaT-&lt;version&gt;；</li>
    <li>包括 bash 和 kaptain 启动脚本；</li>
    <li>创建从  /usr/local/bin 到启动脚本的链接。</li>
  </ul>
  <p>bash 脚本是一个非常基本的文件，可以通过命令行选项手动编辑，以启动和配置 OmegaT 。</p>
  <p>The kaptain script (or "grammar", as kaptain scripts are termed) enables you to select launch and configuration options from a user-friendly GUI. You can for example use it to select the user interface language, assign more memory to OmegaT, or enter a Google Translate password. You can customize the kaptain launch script so that your preferences are the defaults; simply edit the omegat.kaptn file in a text editor. The file is commented to help you. For the kaptain script to work, however, you must first install kaptain. If it is not in your distribution's repository, you can <a href="http://kaptain.sourceforge.net">download it from kaptain.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

  </p>
  <p>The installation script provides added convenience, but you can still install OmegaT on Linux manually if you prefer. Simply unpack the archive in the folder of your choice. The launch scripts will not be written to your execution path in this case.</p>
  <h3>从命令行启动 OmegaT</h3>
  <p>OmegaT does not have to be launched from the command line, but doing so may be useful as it provides debugging information. To launch from the command line, open a terminal window (root permissions are not needed). Navigate to the folder containing the file OmegaT.jar, e.g.:</p>
  <p> cd /opt/omegat/OmegaT_2.3.4</p>
  <p>并用 ENTER 键确认。</p>
  <p>Then enter the launch command itself, and confirm with ENTER. The basic launch command is:</p>
  <p> java -jar OmegaT.jar</p>
  <p>该命令区分大小写。</p>
  <p>If you are relying on or wish to use a Java installation that is not installed at system level, this will not be sufficient: you must also instruct your system where to find Java. If you have installed a version of OmegaT with JRE supplied, the launch script supplied already contains this path for you. If you have installed an additional version of Java but have not made it the default version at system level, you must include the whole path of the Java binary in the launch command. This will be something like /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.16/jre/bin/java; make a note of where Java is installed during installation so that you can find it again. The command will therefore be (in this case):</p>
  <p> /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.16/jre/bin/java -jar OmegaT.jar</p>
  <p>In your launch script, do not confuse the path to OmegaT.jar and the path to the java command. The first (with the cd command) is needed if your launch script is not in the same folder as OmegaT.jar. The second is needed if the Java version you wish to use is not the default installation at system level.</p>
  <h3>从启动脚本运行 OmegaT</h3>
  <p>As already mentioned, a bash launch script is provided with OmegaT. Once this has been copied or linked to your execution path (done automatically if you use the installation script provided), you can launch OmegaT by hitting <i>Alt+F2</i>, then typing in <i>omegat</i> and conforming with ENTER.</p>
  <p>默认情况下，bash 启动脚本是可执行的，但是您的系统可能会更改其权限（例如在解压缩存档时），您可能需要再次更改权限使其可执行。</p>
  <h3>通过用户友好方式启动 OmegaT</h3>
  <p>To make launching OmegaT even more user-friendly, add it to your application launch menu, or place a launch icon for it on your desktop or in your desktop panel. The possibilities are numerous, and the procedures for implementing them no less numerous, owing to the plethora of distributions.</p>
  <h3>Linux 版 OmegaT 的字体样式</h3>
  <p>Linux版 OmegaT 的字体样式由于以下因素可能会有较大差异：</p>
  <ul>
    <li>所使用的 Java 版本（在 Java 的 Sun 和 OpenJDK 版本上，相同的字体可能显示的样式不同）</li>
    <li>可用的字体/所选的字体</li>
    <li>字体大小</li>
    <li>是否启用了抗锯齿功能（这是一个命令行启动选项，但您也可以在kaptain启动脚本中进行设置）</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>卸载 OmegaT</h3>
  <p>从系统中删除所有 OmegaT 的内容：</p>
  <p>Delete the OmegaT program folder. This can easily be restored again in the future.</p>
  <p>Delete the folder /home/&lt;user&gt;/.omegat of any user account from which OmegaT has been launched. This will result in deletion of any user configuration settings that have been made (such as changes to the segmentation rules), and – if the folder is deleted "properly", i.e. not simply moved to trash, cannot be restored.</p>
  <p>删除所有启动脚本并删除桌面上所有OmegaT的自定义条目。</p>
  <p>卸载 OmegaT 不会从您的系统中删除任何 OmegaT 项目，除非您将这些项目放入了 OmegaT 程序或配置文件的文件夹中，最好不要将这些文件放在这些位置。</p>
