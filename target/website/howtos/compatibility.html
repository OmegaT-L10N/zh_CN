<p>这篇 HOWTO 描述了 OmegaT 与其他软件产品的兼容性。</p>

<h3>整体评论</h3>

<p>对于专业翻译人员而言，以数字形式收发文本是标准流程，因此 OmegaT 的用户自然会关心其与其他软件产品的兼容性。本指南旨在提供该领域的信息。</p>

<p>一般而言：“兼容性”并不是一个非黑即白的问题。如果软件产品供应商声称其产品与其他软件兼容，则这种兼容性很少是完美的。反过来，在产品显然不能直接兼容的情况下，也往往能找到让它们能协同运作的操作流程。效果及所需的投入是否可接受才是必答题，但这又仁者见仁，智者见智。换句话说，“兼容性”不仅涉及产品本身，还与工作流程有关。<br/>

</p>


<h3>操作系统</h3>

<p>OmegaT 可在任何可以运行合适版本的 Java 运行环境（JRE）的操作系统上运行。目前，这包括从 Windows 98 开始的所有版本的Microsoft Windows、Mac OS X 和大多数 Linux 发行版。 </p>

<h3>原文文本（待翻译文件）</h3>

<p>有关所有支持的文件格式的最新列表，请参阅 OmegaT 用户手册。以下列表仅限于典型用户特别感兴趣的那些格式，<strong>并非</strong> OmegaT 支持的所有文件格式的详尽列表。</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    
    <p><strong>Microsoft Office 2007-2010（Word、Excel、PowerPoint 2007-2010）、Office Open XML：</strong></p>

    <p>OmegaT 能够直接处理当前的 Microsoft Office 格式，而无需转换为其他格式或从其他格式转换。</p>

<p>Microsoft Office 2007-2010 文件格式（也称为 Office Open XML，文件扩展名为 .docx、.xlsx 和 .pptx）与被它们所取代的Office 97-2003 格式完全不同。实际上，它们的结构与 OpenOffice.org 文件的结构非常相似：它们由包含多个文件的 zip 档案所构成，而其中那些包含文本的文件基于 XML 标准。这让 CAT 工具更容易支持并直接编辑它。Microsoft Office 2007-2010 文件格式可以直接在 OmegaT 中处理；更多信息可以在<a href="./docx.html">此处</a>找到。</p>
    
    <p>对于尚未拥有 2007 版本的 Microsoft Office 的用户，可以使用 Microsoft 在<a href="http://www.download.com/Microsoft-Open-XML-Converter/3000-18483_4-146736.html">此处</a>提供的免费插件转换器来实现 Office Open XML 和 Microsoft Office 98-2003 之间的转换。此转换器适用于 Windows 和 Mac。</p>
  
    <p>Office Open XML 可以直接转换为 OpenDocument 格式，然后通过可在<a href="http://odf-converter.sourceforge.net/download.html">此处</a>获得的 ODF 转换器转回。此工具需要有某个版本的 MS Office（XP / 2003/2007）才能用。<br/></p>

    <p>Mac OS X 用户可在 <a href="http://www.neooffice.org/">NeoOffice</a> 中将 Office Open XML 与 OpenDocument 格式互相转换。</p>

    <p>Linux 用户可以用这个版本的独立<a href="http://www.oooninja.com/2008/01/convert-openxml-docx-etc-in-linux-using.html">转换工具</a>直接进行 Office Open XML 与 OpenDocument 格式的互相转换。</p>

    <p>最新版的 OpenOffice.org 能将 Microsoft Office 2007 与 Open Document 格式互相转换。</p>

  </li>

  <li>

    <p><strong>Microsoft Office 97-2003（Microsoft Word/Excel/Powerpoint 2003）：</strong></p>

    <p>这些文件格式是专有的、二进制的，且至今尚未公布相应文档，这些特性使得它们极难用 CAT 工具处理。&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>有些 CAT 工具通过在 Word 软件自身内工作来克服这个问题，至少对于 MS Word 而言克服了；大部分其他 CAT 工具只能先将其转换成 RTF 处理再转回，此过程通常对于翻译人员是不可见的。</p>

    <p>OmegaT 不直接支持这些文件格式。相反，必须先将这些文件手动转换成 Office Open XML（MS Office 2007/2010）或者 OpenDocument 格式（LibreOffice 或 OpenOffice.org）才能在 OmegaT 中处理。（OmegaT 在这方面远非独一无二：许多其他 CAT 工具在翻译人员进行翻译之前会将源文件转换为另一种格式，某些情况下这个过程是在后台进行的，翻译人员并不会意识到这一事实。）</p>

  </li>

  <li>
        
    <p><strong>RTF（Rich Text Format，富文本格式）：</strong></p>

    <p>RTF 在结构上与 Microsoft Office 98-2003 文件格式完全不同，但是对于 OmegaT 而言状况是一样的：不直接支持，必须首先转换为 .docx（MS Office 2007/2010）或 OpenDocument 格式（ LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org）。</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>OpenDocument 格式：LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org/NeoOffice Writer/Calc/Impress</strong></p>
    
    <p>These file formats are the equivalent of Microsoft Office's
formats. The Open Document Format is an international standard and has
replaced the former proprietary (but open) Star Office file format (two different but very similar file formats). OmegaT has file filters for both Open Document Format and for the Star Office format which it replaced. These file filters are excellent, and the risk of damaging the formatting of a LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org, etc. file during translation in OmegaT is extremely low.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    
    <p><strong>HTML、XHTML：</strong></p>

    <p>HTML and XHTML, its XML equivalent, are the most common file
format for web pages. Again, OmegaT has excellent file filters for
both. Like OpenOffice.org files, these file formats can be translated
in OmegaT with very little risk of corruption. It is however worth customizing the filter settings for optimum results.</p>

  </li>

</ul>


<h3>翻译记忆</h3>

<p>An international standard exists for translation memories: TMX, or Translation Memory eXchange. It has been widely adopted and is supported by almost all current CAT tools.</p>


<p>The TMX standard exists both in different <strong>versions</strong> and in different <strong>levels</strong>.
The distinction is important for compatibility purposes. The standard is still undergoing development; this is what the different versions refer to. The levels refer to the formatting information that is contained in the TMX file:</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    
    <p>Level 1 TMX 文件不包含任何格式信息。</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    
    <p>Level 2 TMX files contain formatting information, but these files are typically only compatible when the same CAT tool is used. In other words, if an OmegaT user finds a 100% match in a Level 2 OmegaT TMX file, it can be accepted without requiring adaptation, but the same would not be true for a Level 2 TMX file produced by a different CAT tool (or vice-versa). This has repercussions for workflows in which CAT tool users (typically customers) expect to receive translation memory files and to have 100% matches inserted automatically.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    
    <p>Level 3 TMX files contain formatting information in a form that can be read by other CAT tools. Support for Level 3 in CAT tools is rare.</p>

  </li>

</ul>

<p>Certain other CAT tools (such as TRADOS) are able to export different TMX files in different versions. OmegaT
supports all current versions of TMX, but is likely to deliver better match results if the TMX file is version 1.4b.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tools which support different levels of TMX files are in principle still compatible with each other. The formatting information contained in the higher levels will be meaningless to the "other" tool, but the textual information can still be viewed, fuzzy matches found, etc.</p>


<p>OmegaT uses the international TMX standard as its native translation memory format. Some CAT tools still employ dedicated proprietary translation memory formats, but virtually all support the import and export of TMX files. In practice, it is therefore possible for translators to deliver translation memories to customers and vice-versa, and for the recipient to use these files for immediate or future reference; if the files are to be used within an automated workflow, however, the constraint described above applies.</p>

<p>TMX 文件其他注意事项：</p>

<p>The TMX standard contains definitions of what characters are permissible. Not all CAT tools are equally strict in their observance of these definitions; consequently, some CAT tools are unable to open TMX files produced by certain other CAT tools directly. OmegaT is generally observant of the conditions and tolerant of other tools' failure to observe them; should problems arise here, however, they can generally be resolved fairly easily by a search &amp; replace in a text editor of the illegal character in the TMX file.</p>

<p>TMX files are in the Unicode encoding, but may be UTF-8 or UTF-16. TMX files produced on Windows systems may begin with a byte-order mark (BOM). This differences do not generally lead to compatibility problems.</p>

<p>Compatibility problems may be caused by differences in the language codes employed. OmegaT supports language codes in the format "xx", "XX", "xx-YY" and "XX-YY", where xx or XX is the language, yy or YY the region. Strictly speaking, the ISO standard for language codes requires "xx-YY" (for example: "en-GB" for British English); although this variant is supported by OmegaT, the default convention offered by OmegaT is "XX-YY", e.g. "EN-GB". OmegaT is tolerant when reading TMX files: it will accept files with en-GB, en-US, en, EN, etc. Not all CAT tools exhibit the same tolerance and some may&nbsp;not therefore display the expected matches if the language codes are not sufficiently compliant. This incompatibility can be resolved by searching for and
replacing the relevant language codes in the TMX file in a suitable text editor. Another possible source of incompatibility are three-digit language codes, which are not supported by OmegaT at all. (This incidentally is a limitation of Java, not of OmegaT itself.)  </p>

<p>专利性翻译记忆要点：</p>

<p>The traditional Wordfast translation memory file format is of particular interest owing to its simplicity: it consists of a
plain-text file with a translation unit (segment) on each line in which the source and target are separated by a tab. This format can be converted easily to the TMX format by third-party utilities such as <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wordfast/files/Wf2Tmx-1.0.11.37.zip">Wf2TMX</a>. <a href="http://anaphraseus.sourceforge.net/">Anaphraseus</a> can also be used for this purpose.</p>

<h3>术语表文件</h3>

<p>OmegaT's 术语表文件为以下格式的纯文本文件</p>

<p>源语言术语&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;tab&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;目标语言术语&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;tab&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 附属信息</p>

<p>某些其他 CAT 工具也能导入、导出该格式的术语表文件，或者可从该格式简单转换得到的类似纯文本格式 (比如通过Microsoft Word 的查找与替换操作）。</p>

<p>OmegaT 还能读取 TBX 格式的术语表，该格式是术语表文件的行业标准文件格式。</p>

<p>OmegaT 不能读取专利性的二进制文件格式，如 Trados Multiterm。</p>

<h3>双语 CAT-工具格式</h3>

<p>Many CAT tools make use of an intermediate bilingual file format, i.e. a file containing both source and target language segments, and in some cases also the structure of the original file. Originally, these bilingual file formats may have been a by-product of the tool's architecture. They have however become an important phenomenon in translation workflows involving CAT tools, and they&nbsp;often present the greatest obstacle to compatibility between OmegaT and other CAT tools (or for that matter between CAT tools in general).</p>

<p>客户要求交付特殊形式的双语文件格式（而不仅仅是译后文件，可能再加上翻译记忆）原因至少由以下三点：</p>

<p>1. Some CAT tools, notably TRADOS, are able to import a wide range of file formats, including desktop publishing formats, and to prepare them for translation in the tool concerned. The "prepared" form is typically the tool's bilingual file format. Without preparation in this way, the original file format may be accessible to the translator.</p>

<p>2. The translation stage is only part of the customer's workflow. The translation may for example be passed to a checker for editing. If the checker's changes are to be included in a translation memory repository maintained by the customer, the changes need to be made <i>before</i> the final documents are created. This can be done either within the CAT tool concerned, or in some cases in an external bilingual file format which the tool is capable of reading.</p>

<p>3. The customer wishes to receive a translation memory against which texts can be run in the future: in other words, to "pretranslate" future texts against an existing translation memory. In order for this process to be as automatic as possible, two conditions must in particular be met: firstly, the translation memory must contain formatting information (see above); and secondly, the segmentation rules applied to the text must be the same as those applied when the translation memory (or part of it) was produced. The easiest way for a customers to ensure that these two conditions are met is for them to pretranslate the text themselves before passing it to the translator (thereby defining how it is segmented), and to create the translation memory in the CAT tool of their choice after receiving the translated intermediate bilingual file from the translator (thereby ensuring that the formatting information contained within the translation memory will be compatible with future projects).</p>

<p>Several of the bilingual file formats can be handled by OmegaT, and not necessarily with great effort. An understanding of the processes involved is however important. The individual bilingual file formats are described below.</p>

<p><strong>XLIFF</strong></p>

<p>XLIFF is the industry-standard bilingual file format. It is supported by several CAT tools, and in fact some CAT tools are
effectively "designed around" the XLIFF standard: Heartsome and Swordfish are examples. Since it is a standard, an advantage of XLIFF is that file filters provided by one CAT tool vendor for conversion between a certain format and XLIFF (and, following completion of the translation workflow, back again) can in theory be used to prepare files in the format concerned for translation in any CAT tool capable of supporting XLIFF. In practice, working with the XLIFF workflow often requires the use of tools that are not very user-friendly.</p>

<p>OmegaT has rudimentary support for XLIFF, and a procedure for using XLIFF in OmegaT in conjunction with the Rainbow tools can be found <a href="http://okapi.sourceforge.net/Release/Shared/Help/tutorial_02.htm">here</a>. The filters available are mainly for file formats peculiar to the IT industry rather than end-user files.<a href="http://okapi.sourceforge.net/Release/Shared/Help/tutorial_02.htm"></a></p>

<p><strong>Trados “不干净的富文本格式 RTF”</strong></p>

<p>The Trados "uncleaned" RTF file format, often referred to simply as "uncleaned files", has for many years been the most common bilingual file format used in translation workflows. It owes its origins to the use of MS Word as an interface for the Trados CAT tool. In addition to Trados, however, several other CAT tools also support the "uncleaned RTF" format, notably Wordfast Classic.  </p>

<p>Essentially, this format consists of an RTF file in which the source and target segments alternate. These segments are marked and delimited by special characters and MS Word formatting styles.</p>

<p>A script (for Windows only) and procedure was recently (2008) developed enabling OmegaT users to produce Trados uncleaned RTF files for delivery at the end of their translation stage. For details, see the&nbsp;<a href="export_uncleaned_rtf">"Exporting from OmegaT to uncleaned RTF" HOWTO</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Trados TTX</strong></p>

<p>Trados TTX format is the counterpart to the "uncleaned RTF" format for Trados Tag Editor, which unlike Trados Workbench, does not work in direct combination with MS&nbsp;Word. TTX is an XML-based format. An <a href="http://www.opentag.com/okapi/wiki/index.php?title=Okapi_Filters_Plugin_for_OmegaT">OmegaT plugin</a> is now available by means of which this format can be handled in OmegaT.</p>

<p><strong>Wordfast TXML</strong></p>

<p>Wordfast TXML is the native internal format of Wordfast's new Wordfast Professional (also known as Wordfast 6.0). As its name suggests, it is an XML-based format. It is supported by OmegaT.</p>

<p><strong>Déjà Vu "外部视图"</strong></p>

<p>An interesting feature of Déjà Vu DVX is its "External View" file format. This file format enables OmegaT users to deliver
bilingual files to users of Déjà Vu DVX, who are then able to edit them further or to incorporate them into automated workflows. For details, see the <a href="compatibility_deja_vu">Déjà Vu "External View" HOWTO</a>.<br/></p>
