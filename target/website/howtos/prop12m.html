<h3>介绍</h3>

<p>本指南介绍了OmegaT的自动匹配传播和一对多匹配功能。.</p>

<h3>传播</h3>

<p>By default, OmegaT uses automatic match propagation. This means that as soon as a segment is translated, the same translation is automatically inserted into all identical segments. If a segment has already been translated and an identical segment later on in the text is then changed, the earlier segment will be brought into line with the changed segment. Segments which occur more than once are described in OmegaT as "non-unique segments".</p>

<p>Selecting View &gt; Mark Non-Unique Segments causes only the first instance of a non-unique segment to be displayed in black, and second and subsequent instances to be displayed in grey. This is useful when a translation is being checked, since only the first instance of identical segments may need to be checked. The user can therefore see immediately that a segment in grey, rather than black, has already been checked. (If Options &gt; View &gt; "Include the first non-unique segment when marking non-unique segments" is selected, all non-unique segments including the first are marked in this way.)</p>

<p>You can disable the auto-propagation function with Project &gt; Properties &gt; uncheck the "Auto-propagation of Translations" box. This has the effect of making all instances of non-unique segments alternative translations (see "One-to-many matching" below).</p>

<h3>一对多匹配</h3>

<p>In most cases, the translator will wish to translate identical segments within a project in the same way. For cases where two or more identical segments require different translations, OmegaT offers "one-to-many matching".</p>

<p>OmegaT's one-to-many matching function first assumes that identical segments are to be translated in the same way. This translation is described as the "default translation". To produce a translation that is different from the "default translation", right-click with the mouse within the segment and select "Create Alternative Translation". This segment can be now translated as desired without other instances of it automatically being made identical to it.</p>

<p>你可以为相同片段设置多种“可选翻译”，但只能有一种默认翻译（或完全没有）。</p>

<p>To make an alternative translation the default translation, right-click with the mouse and select "Use as Default Translation". This will make the current translation the default translation. All other instances of the same segment that were previously the "default translation" will now be brought into line with this translation.</p>

<p>如果你已经翻译过一例非唯一片段，并且希望为这非唯一片段制作一种不同的默认翻译，同时还不想改变已经翻译过的实例的译文，你必须先用“创建可选翻译”将已翻译片段设定为“可选翻译”状态，</p>

<p>To remove the "alternative translation" status of a single segment and bring it back into line with the "default translation", simply delete the content of the segment. This has the effect of deleting the "alternative translation" status at the same time; the translation of the segment will therefore revert to that of the default translation. The content of a segment can be deleted completely either by means of the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+A &gt; Ctrl+X &gt; Enter, by right-clicking with the mouse and the Remove Translation menu item, or simply by using the delete key (repeatedly).</p>


<h3>传输摘要与一对多匹配指令</h3>

<p><b>无</b> （默认行为）：所有相同片段都自动以同样形式翻译</p>

<p><b>标记非唯一片段</b>：相同片段都用灰色标记（改变显示，而非行为）。</p>

<p><b>Create Alternative Translation</b>: makes the segment unique. Changes to this segment have no effect upon other segments, nor do changes to the "default translation" affect it.</p>

<p><b>撤销翻译</b>删掉片段内容，（当按下Enter键后）会插入默认翻译。</p>

<p><b>用作默认翻译</b>：活跃片段被用做默认翻译，因此所有采用之前“默认翻译”的片段都与当前默认翻译保持一直。</p>



<h3>指向说明</h3>

<p>For some file types, OmegaT differentiates between identical segments by referring to their preceding and following segments. Creating an "alternative translation" therefore relies upon identical segments having different preceding or following segments. Where two segments also have identical preceding and following segments (for example when an entire page appears twice in the text), they cannot be translated differently from each other in OmegaT, i.e. it is not possible to make one of them an "alternative translation".</p>

<p>"Non-unique segment" covers both default and alternative translations. Consequently, segments that are marked (with the grey font) as being non-unique are marked as non-unique irrespective of whether alternative translations have been created or not.</p>

<p>By default, the Go To Next Untranslated Segment command (Ctrl+U) skips to the next untranslated segment, skipping propagated translations in the process. If Options &gt; Editing Behaviour &gt; "Go To Next Untranslated Segment stops when there is at least one alternative translation" is selected however and at least one alternative translation of a non-unique segment has been created, this function treats all instances of that segment (whether default or alternative translations) as untranslated, i.e. does not skip them.</p>
